# A proc is the object form of a block, behaves like a block.

# The Proc object creates a new binding when it is instantiated
#   When calling the proc, we can ask for the value of the variable.

# However, if we define the Proc object before instantiating the var value
#   It will raise an error.

# Thus, any variables accessed in a proc should be defined before
#   the proc is created or passed as an argument.

# We can, however, change the variable after it has been defined in the main context since
#   the procâ€™s binding holds a reference to it instead of copying it.

# Blocks are basically nameless functions.
# You may be familiar with the lambda from other languages like Lisp or Python.
# Basically, you can pass a nameless function to another function, and then that
#   function can invoke the passed-in nameless function.
#       For example, a function could perform iteration by passing one item at a time to
#           the nameless function. This is a common style, called higher order function style,
#           among languages that can handle functions as first class objects.
#           Lisp does it. Python does it .Even C does it with function pointers.
#           Many other languages do this style of programming.
#           In Ruby, the difference is mainly a different kind of syntax for
#           higher order functions. In other languages, you have to specify explicitly
#           that a function can accept another function as an argument.
#           But in Ruby, any method can be called with a block as an implicit argument.
#           Inside the method, you can call the block using the yield keyword with a value.

# Basically, blocks are designed for loop abstraction.
# The most basic usage of blocks is to let you define your own way for iterating over
#    the items.

# By using blocks, we can hide the loop logic inside the method or function.
# So for example by calling list.reverse_each , you can do a reverse iteration over
#   the list without knowing how the list is implemented on the inside.

# Yes, and that also means you can define many ways to iterate. You could provide
#   a forward way to iterate, a backward way, and so on.
#   It's up to you. C# has an iterator, but it has just one iterator per class.
#       In Ruby you can have an arbitrary number of iterators if you want.
#   If you have a tree class, for example, which you think people will want to
#   traverse depth first and breadth first, you can provide both kinds of traversal by
#       providing two different methods.

# The details of how to iterate should belong to the service provider class.
#   The client should know as little as possible. That was the original purpose of blocks.
#   In fact, in early versions of Ruby, the methods called with blocks were
#       referred to as iterators, because they were designed to iterate.
#       But in the history of Ruby, the role of blocks was
#           later enhanced from loop abstraction to anything.
# For example, we can create a closure out of a block. A closure is
#   a nameless function the way it is done in Lisp.
#   You can pass around a nameless function object, the closure, to
#       another method to customize the behavior of the method.
#       As another example, if you have a sort method to sort an array or list,
#           you can pass a block to define how to compare the elements.
#       This is not iteration. This is not a loop. But it is using blocks.

# Refer here https://www.artima.com/intv/closures.html#part2
# and here: https://skorks.com/2010/05/closures-a-simple-explanation-using-ruby/

# A closure is basically a function/method that has the following two properties:
#   You can pass it around like an object (to be called later)
#   It remembers the values of all the variables that were
#       in scope when the function was created.
#       It is then able to access those variables
#           when it is called even though they may no longer be in scope.

# In order for the language to be able to support closures, it must support
#   first-class functions.
#   A first class function is a function that can be treated like an object in that you can
#       store it in collections and pass it as a parameter to other functions.
#   As I said, the ability to be passed around is the first property of a closure.

# A normal function is defined in a particular scope (i.e. in a class) and can only be called
#   within that scope.
#   This function has access to all the variables in the scope that it is defined,
#       like the parameters that are passed into it as well as class variables.

# A closure on the other hand may be defined in one scope and be called
#   in a completely different scope (since we can pass it around before calling it).
#       Because of this, when a closure is created, it retains the values of
#          all the variables that were in scope when the closure was defined.
#       Even if the variables are generally no longer in scope when the closure is called,
#           within the closure they still are.
#       In other words, the closure retains knowledge of its lexical environment
#           at the time it was defined.

# In that sense, I gotta change the scope to test if I can access the lexical env from closures
# as its property.
